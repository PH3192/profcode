   <h2>Metallica - For Whom the Bell Tolls</h2>

   <img src="imagens/Metallica.jpg"><br>

   <strong>Letra:</strong><br><br>

<strong>Make his fight on the hill in the early day<br>
Constant chill deep inside<br>
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey<br>
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?<br>
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know<br>
Stiffened wounds test their pride<br>
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow<br>
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know<br><br>
For whom the bell tolls<br>
Time marches on<br>
For whom the bell tolls<br><br>
Take a look to the sky just before you die<br>
It's the last time you will<br>
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky<br>
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry<br>
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery<br>
Hears the silence so loud<br>
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be<br>
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see<br><br>
For whom the bell tolls<br>
Time marches on<br>
For whom the bell tolls<br><br></strong>
